# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a collection of algorithm visualizers implemented in various programming languages. These visualizers help to understand the working of popular algorithms by visually demonstrating each step.

## Algorithms Included:

### Searching Algorithms:
1. **[Linear Search Visualizer](Searching Algorithms\linear_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Linear Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Linear Search traverses through an array to find a target value.
2. **[Binary Search Visualizer](Searching Algorithms\binary_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Binary Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Binary Search works in an array to find a target value.
   Observer the Green Intersection at each step with previous step.

### Sorting Algorithms:
1. **[Bubble Sort Visualizer](Sorting Algorithms\bubble_sort_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Bubble Sort** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Bubble Sort works to sort the Array in a desired order.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan-Zahoor/algorithm-visualizer--console-.git
2. Click on the Program file you want to Visualize.
3. Run the Program and See the Visualization.
