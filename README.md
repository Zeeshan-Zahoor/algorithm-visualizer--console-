# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a collection of algorithm visualizers implemented in various programming languages. These visualizers help to understand the working of popular algorithms by visually demonstrating each step.

## Algorithms Included:

1. **[Linear Search Visualizer](linear_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Linear Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Linear Search traverses through an array to find a target value.
2. **[Binary Search Visualizer](binary_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Binary Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Binary Search works in an array to find a target value.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan-Zahoor/algorithm-visualizer--console-.git
2. Click on the Program file you want to Visualize.
3. Run the Program and See the Visualization.
