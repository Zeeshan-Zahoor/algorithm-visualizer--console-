# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a collection of algorithm visualizers implemented in various programming languages. These visualizers help to understand the working of popular algorithms by visually demonstrating each step.

## Algorithms Included:

### Searching Algorithms:
1. **[Linear Search Visualizer](Searching%20Algorithms/linear_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Linear Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Linear Search works to find a Target number in an Array.
   Sorting Algorithms\bubble_sort_visualizer.cpp
2. **[Binary Search Visualizer](Searching%20Algorithms/binary_search_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Binary Search** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Binary Search works in an array to find a target value.
   Observer the Green Intersection at each step with previous step.

### Sorting Algorithms:
1. **[Bubble Sort Visualizer](Sorting%20Algorithms/bubble_sort_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Bubble Sort** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Bubble Sort works to sort the Array in a desired order.
2. **[Merge Sort Visualizer](Sorting%20Algorithms/merge_sort_visualizer.cpp)**  
   A visualizer for the **Merge Sort** algorithm implemented in C++. It demonstrates how Merge Sort works to sort the Array in a desired order.
## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan-Zahoor/algorithm-visualizer--console-.git
2. Click on the Program file you want to Visualize.
3. Run the Program and See the Visualization.
